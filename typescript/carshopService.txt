Carshop Service

Develop a CarShop Service Management System in TypeScript that models the operations of a car shop. This system will manage the servicing of different types of vehicles (Cars, Trucks, Vans, E-Vehicles) and will involve interactions between various employees (Mechanic, Receiver, Boss, Accountant) to handle the workflow from vehicle check-in to billing. 


The CarShop:
has: 
service history - passed repairs
currentRepairs - the ongoing repairs
pricelist - a list with problems that the Car shop is able to fix and a price for each of them
balance - the current cash amount 

The Receiver:
can:
 receiveVehicle for assessing 
assign a mechanic to specific vehicle based on the type of specialization of the mechanic and the nature of the problem
has:
current vehicle for assessing
The mechanic:
has: 
a type of vehicles that he is able to fix (could be more than one)
currently repairing vehicle
time left for the repair
can:
repair a vehicle
accept a vehicle of repair - generates a repair entity that contains info about estimated time needed and  cost of the repair 
pass the vehicle to the accountant for billing
The accountant: 
can:
issue an invoice
submit the repair into the service history
add to the balance of the Car Shop
generate a report with all the repairs and their cost for a given timerange
has:
a list with repaired cars for processing

The boss:
can:
collect money

General requirement: Each method logs information to the console about what is the system currently doing. For example: 

“Vehicle - Ford, Mondeo 2002 entered the shop and assessment has started”
“Vehicle - Ford, Mondeo 2002 finished all repairs”
etc.


Testing Scenario
Setup:

Create a CarShop instance with a service history, current repairs list, pricelist, and balance initialized.
Instantiate Employee objects for each role (Mechanic, Receiver, Boss, Accountant), each with their specific capabilities and responsibilities.

Vehicle List Creation:

Generate a list of 20 vehicles (Vehicle objects) with varied types (Cars, Trucks, Vans, E-Vehicles) and repair needs (minor to major). Include attributes like model, year, and issue description.
Process Flow:

Check-in: 

Use the Receiver to receive each vehicle, log initial assessment details, and assign a mechanic based on the vehicle type and issue.
Repair: Mechanics work on their assigned vehicles, updating the system with repair status and time estimates. After repairs, they pass information to the Accountant.
Billing: The Accountant generates invoices based on the pricelist and completed work, submits repair details into the service history, and updates the balance.
Finalization: Once all vehicles are processed, the Accountant generates a comprehensive report detailing the repairs made, costs, and any notable issues encountered.
