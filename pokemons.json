Build a page listing this pokemons. 
For each pokemon there should be a card.
On the top of the page implement a searching functionality, that dynamically filters pokemons by name and type. The logical operator for the 2 filters is AND.
Make each pokemon card to contain a button that will add it to a favorites collection. 
The names of all the favorites are listed on the top of the page,below the search filters, along with X button to remove the pokemon from favorites. 
There should be a possibility to remove from favorites also from the pokemon card itself.
